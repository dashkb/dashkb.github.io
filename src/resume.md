### Professional Experience
----------------
#### General Assembly: *Developer in Residence (Contract)*

* SF, CA
* 9/2013 - 12/2013

I was an instructor for the [Web Development Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive) course.  All day, every day, my team of six veteran developers taught a [diverse group of students](http://sfwebdevs.github.io/) Ruby and Javascript, HTML and CSS, the web, Rails, TDD, and everything else we could fit into 12 weeks.  Besides preparing and delivering lessons and labs, we also encouraged exploration and experimentation, shared Hacker News 'book reports', and prepared students for life after GA.  We held 1-1 meetings and mock interviews with students, to give them a taste of being up at the whiteboard with a job at stake.  We also helped students choose projects that were in line with their interests and would be good portfolio pieces.

Below are some samples of class materials I wrote:
* [Javascript Prototypes](https://gist.github.com/dashkb/8183deef4f2859929485)
* [Intro to Sinatra](https://gist.github.com/dashkb/e4aa8cbeac679e223711)
* [Intro Methods (Ruby) and Recursion](https://gist.github.com/dashkb/1df1276af392fd354046)
* [Lab: Backbone.js Models and Events](https://gist.github.com/dashkb/87574e73178cc645ccf4)

#### TapJoy: *Sr. Engineer*
* SF, CA
* 8/2012 - 6/2013

As a backend engineer at [TapJoy](https://www.tapjoy.com/) I was involved in various projects relating to our Ad Server, a very large and complex Rails application.  I collaborated with our data science team to construct an experiments (A/B testing) framework for offers, spearheaded our Ruby 1.8 -> 1.9 upgrade, built features for the product team, and conducted maintenance (keeping tests up to date, looking for areas to improve performance, troubleshooting caches and server clusters, handling escalated client tickets, etc).

As a senior engineer, I contributed to discussions with our remote infrastructure team in Boston about architecture and our monorail-to-service-oriented strategy.  I worked closely with them to keep our teams in sync.  I also made myself available to junior engineers for advice and assistance.  I was fortunate at TapJoy to work with people who were serious about maintaining quality tests, *always* having thorough code reviews, and willing to consistently iterate on our development process.

#### TaskRabbit: *Engineer*
* SF, CA
* 5/2012 - 8/2012
* Security and Performance Team

In my short time at TaskRabbit, I was able increase app server performance by 30% by optimizing SQL queries and locating memory leaks.  I also spent time modernizing and upgrading the Rails 2 codebase, removing cruft and updating or replacing old dependencies.

#### Vitrue, Inc (now Oracle SRM): *Engineer*
* Atlanta, GA
* 11/2010 - 5/2012

My time at Vitrue was divided between two teams.  In reverse chronological order:

On the product team, I worked mostly on our Analytics products, which our clients used to monitor their success with our Social Media products.  My team built a [Rack framework](http://github.com/dashkb/dzl) with the features we needed to ship two reporting engines we were about to build. We made the case to management and got the sprint approved to build it, and approval to open source it.  The investment paid off; we shipped everything smoothly and on time.  Trey and Scribe (code names) each received, validated, and stored massive amounts of data from our two flagship products, Publisher and Tabs.  They supported a frontend (which my team also built) with slice-and-dice querying and visualization of metrics, as well as the SRM Dashboard.  After everything was shipped, I gave a talk to the engineering teams on building DSLs and our performance vs Sinatra (At the time, we were faster!).  Vitrue used Dzl in production until they were acquired by Oracle, and licensing issues forced them to rewrite it.

On the Implementations team, I did contract work for our clients; these were typically short-lived Rails-backed Facebook apps meant to coincide with a brand's ad campaign or special event.  I made branded quizzes, various Facebook/Youtube/Twitter integrations, contests and sweepstakes, or just simple (but pixel perfect) content.

#### musicgearfinder.com: *Contractor*
* Atlanta, GA
* 1/2010 - 11/2010

I took over this site from Highgroove (which is now Big Nerd Ranch).  Unfortunately, http://musicgearfinder.com is down now, but it essentially was an index of local music shops and their inventories by location.  When I started work on the project, the site was buggy and feature-incomplete.  My greatest contribution was adding the product search feature, which was supported by a background CSV import.  I also AJAXified most of the UI and fixed/improved a laundry list of client issues.  Deployments and hosting concerns were also my responsibility.  MGF was a great first experience working with clients and managing a solo production project.
